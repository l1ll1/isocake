About ISOCake

ISOCake is the *final* (unofficial) procedure in any ISO9000 compliant organisation.

When you mess up ISOCake will make it better.

ISO cake simply means that if you mess up in (what is in hindsight) a
preventable manner, you apologise to your co-workers.

In my workplace, most people like cake, so if I mess up and *I* think *I* could
have done better or prevented the mistake (especially by better adherence to
procedures) I bring a cake. No one can tell you to bring an ISOCake. Only *you* can make that decision because *you* want to do better next time

Maybe in your workplace beer works better than cake, or a sorry card, or
flowers. Its up to you.

The idea is that by admitting responsibility for a mistake we will be
more responsible next time. Its also meant to make the workplace more fun. 

The ISO Cake is a personal pledge to be more responsible and mess up less. Next
time you mess up, bring a cake. Leave it in the kitchenette (if you workplace
has one) with a note (or not). Perhaps put the isocake.readthedocs.io URL on
the note. Perhaps sign your name (you don't have to, its enough that you want
to do better). 

Hopefully we will all do better over time before anyone gets fat from eating too much ISOCake.

Sincerely,
